## Description 

Uncertainty and complexity are ever-present challenges in modern politics. Governments and societies worldwide face a series of impending transitions—spanning infrastructure, geopolitics, the environment, and society—each affecting nearly every aspect of life and necessitating coordinated action across local, national, and international policy levels. To navigate these challenges, policymakers increasingly turn to scientists and experts for evidence-based insights. However, making informed decisions in the face of urgent and multifaceted crises remains a formidable task.

In recent years, computational techniques—such as modeling and simulation, data science, and artificial intelligence—have become integral to political and governance processes. Additionally, a growing number of international collaborations between academics and governments are fostering co-created solutions, blending scientific expertise with real-world policymaking. Yet, despite the expanding role of computational science in governance, the academic fields of computational policy and diplomacy remain in their early stages of development.

Over the past two decades, network science has proven to be a powerful framework for modeling complex, interacting systems, traditionally representing them as nodes (agents) linked by pairwise edges. However, many real-world systems involve interactions that extend beyond simple one-to-one relationships, requiring a more advanced formulation [21, 6]. Higher-Order networks such as hypergraphs offer a compelling solution by generalizing traditional networks: rather than limiting connections to pairs, hypergraphs enable interactions among multiple participants. This marks a fundamental shift from pairwise connections to one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, allowing for a more nuanced representation of complex systems.

A key example of this is opinion dynamics, a central topic in social systems research. Conventional graph-based models assume that interactions occur exclusively between pairs of individuals, but real-world discourse often takes place in group settings where multiple people engage simultaneously—whether in political debates, multilateral negotiations, or online communities. This makes hypergraphs particularly valuable for modeling group discussions, collective decision-making processes, and the complex diffusion of opinions in society.

The CoDiP Workshop seeks to unite computational scientists working at the intersection of modeling, computational analysis, and decision-making in diplomacy, politics, and governance. By fostering a collaborative community, the workshop aims to advance knowledge, share experiences, and address fundamental scientific challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
