ICCS 2023 will host the first workshop on Computational Diplomacy and Policy. The aim of the workshop is to bring together people from these two new emerging fields and attempt to address shared challenges. This is done in collaboration with the Universities of Amsterdam, Geneva and Durham. Within these universities there are ongoing initiatives applying computational techniques, and in particular computational modelling, to address decision-making challenges in policy and diplomacy.

At Amsterdam, the [POLDER](polder.center) initiative is developing co-created research and new educational programmes around complexity, policy and social systems. The University of Geneva, through the [Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator](https://gesda.global/how-it-all-started/) is building a new group around computational diplomacy. The University of Durham, through the [Durham Research Methods Centre](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/research-methods/) is working with scholars and non-academic partners to develop interdisciplinary methods training and research.

This annual workshop will provide a platform for scientists and policy makers to share and discuss the latest developments in these emerging areas.
